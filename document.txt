Interactive Reader with LangChain
Project Overview
Introduction

The Interactive Reader with LangChain is a Streamlit application designed to provide an interactive reading experience for PDF documents. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and chat models from LangChain, this application allows users to ask questions about the content of uploaded PDFs and receive informative responses.
Features

    User-Friendly Interface: The application offers an intuitive user interface through Streamlit, making it easy for users to interact with PDF documents.

    NLP-Powered Chat Interaction: LangChain's NLP and chat models enable users to ask questions about the document, receiving chat-like responses for enhanced understanding.

    Interactive Document Display: The application dynamically displays relevant pages of the document, allowing users to visualize the context of the responses.

LangChain Overview
What is LangChain?

LangChain is a natural language processing (NLP) library and framework designed for various language-related tasks. It provides tools and models for tasks such as text embedding, document retrieval, and conversational AI. LangChain is built on top of popular NLP libraries and frameworks, making it accessible and extensible for developers.
Key Features of LangChain

    Embeddings: LangChain supports embedding models for converting textual data into vector representations suitable for various NLP tasks.

    Retrieval Models: LangChain provides retrieval models for efficient document and text search, enabling applications like document summarization and chat-based systems.

    Conversational AI: The framework includes tools for building conversational AI systems, allowing developers to create interactive chat applications.
